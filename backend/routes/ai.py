"""
AI-powered summaries and reports, using Groq's OpenAI-compatible API.

Design principles:
- READ-ONLY: these endpoints only read data and generate text. The LLM has
  no ability to add/edit/delete anything — that's deliberate. Write-actions
  via LLM are a Phase 2 feature that would need a confirmation flow.
- FAIL-SAFE: if GROQ_API_KEY isn't configured or Groq is down/rate-limited,
  these endpoints return a clear error message and nothing else in the app
  is affected.
- Data privacy note: student data (name, grades, attendance, fee totals) is
  sent to Groq's API to generate the summary. Groq's API policy does not
  train on API data, but school owners should know AI features send data to
  a third-party service.
